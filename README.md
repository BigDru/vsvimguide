Stack: Visual Studio 2017 - Resharper 2017 - VsVim 2.3

Work in progress!  The guide highlights useful editing commands while programming using VsVim.  

Vims power comes from chaining combinations together, and while much of vim is well documented it is often hard to learn effective combo!

This guide ( currently ) assumes VsVim doesn't bind to any of the modifier keys ( like ctrl ) which leaves Resharpers bindings as default

If there are any editing scenarios in relation to C# coding not covered raise an issue, or, if you have a scenario you think would be good for the guide, raise a PR


# VsVim Fundamentals

The main reason for this guide is essentially how to use VsVim effectively with visual studio and resharper.  It's a semi niche corner of the coding world. So one of the most important things is to be reasonablly effective with vim editing ( and sepecifically VsVim ).  But often we step outside of Vim and make use of resharper / auto complete / refactorings / code generation / templates / Visual Studio hot keys to better leverage all the toys at our disposal


## Changing Text


```cw```  - changes the word from the cusor to the end of the word

```ciw``` - changes the entire worth that the cursor is on

```cf<char>``` - changes text until you find the chararcter <char>, includes the find char

```ct<char>``` - changes text until you find the charracter <char>, but don't include the char

```c<n>f<char>``` -  same as previous cf but find the nth occurance of the char

```c<n>t<char>``` -  same as previous ct but find the nth occurance of the char

```r<char>``` - replaces the character under the cursor

```<n>r<char>``` - replaces the next <n> characters from the cursor with <char>

```R``` - overwrite mode / Replace characters

```s``` - substitute, remove the character under cursor and enter insert mode

```<n>s``` - remove the next <n> characters and enter insert mode


```o``` - open ( leave in insert mode) a new line under current line with correct indenting

```O``` - same as o, but open above

```x``` - delete character

```dd``` - delete line

```u``` - undo

```A``` - append to end of current line ( leaves in insert mode )

```a``` - append after current cursor (leaves in insert mode )

## Navigaton

```h``` - cursor left

```j``` - cursor down

```k``` - cursor up

```l``` - cursor down

```w``` - beginning of next word

```e``` - end of next word

```b``` - beginning of previous word,  if in the middle of a word, it goes back to the beginning of that word

```gd``` - goto defention ( use ontop of methods  / classes etc )

```zz``` - center current line in center of screen
